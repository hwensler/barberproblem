/**
 *The barber shop has one barber, one barber chair, and n chairs for
 * waiting customers, if any, to sit on. If there are no customers present,
 * the barber sits down in the barber chair and falls asleep.
 * When a customer arrives and the barber is sleeping, s/he has to wake
 * up the sleeping barber. If additional customers arrive while the
 * barber is cutting a customerâ€™s hair, they either sit down (if
 * there are empty chairs) or wait for the empty chairs (if all chairs
 * are full). The problem is to program the barber and the customers
 * without getting into race conditions.
 *
 * max customers = 25.
